| **Docker**                | Serves as the main container platform for testing and running the majority of my applications. I plan to migrate most of my services to k8s eventually.            |
| **Portainer**             | Portainer provides a user-friendly web UI for managing Docker.                                                                                                     |
| **Kubernetes (k3s)**      | Runs a lightweight k3s cluster. I plan to migrate more services from Docker once I've simplified the workflow.                                                     |
| **Flux**                  | Manages my k3s cluster configuration using a GitOps approach, automatically syncing the cluster's state with a Git repository.                                     |
| **OpenTelemetry**         | Acts as the foundation of the observability stack by collecting telemetry data from the cluster and applications.                                                  |
| **Prometheus**            | Stores all time-series metrics from the Kubernetes cluster, enabling monitoring.                                                                                   |
| **Loki**                  | Centralizes all logs generated by the Kubernetes cluster for easier troubleshooting and analysis.                                                                  |
| **Grafana**               | UI for the observability stack with custom dashboards to display metrics from Prometheus and logs from Loki.                                                       |
| **Traefik**               | The ingress controller, resolves user-friendly local domains to services running on Docker, Kubernetes, or anywhere on my network.                                 |
| **Tailscale**             | Creates a private mesh VPN, providing secure remote access to my entire network and its services without exposing anything to the public internet.                 |
| **Syncthing**             | Synchronizes files across all my devices, including phones.                                                                                                        |

| **Frigate**               | The open-source NVR for my home camera, and just as importantly, for checking in on Maia üê∂ when I'm away from home.                                               |
| **Home Assistant**        | Serves as the central brain of my smart home, orchestrating automations and controlling IoT devices like sensors, lights, and switches across Matter, Zigbee, etc. |
